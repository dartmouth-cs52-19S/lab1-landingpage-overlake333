# lab1-landingpage-overlake333
In this assignment, I created a landing page based on the Starbucks website.
I mimicked the structure of the page but with my own content - a motorcycle blog.
Using Chrome DevTools, I mimiced the Starbuck's structure and style. My webpage has a responsive navigation menu, expanding images, hover states, text input bars, and footer links. 

I was inspired to create a motorcycle block because, as someone who rides motorcycles,
I have always wanted to take my bike cross-country and document the process.
