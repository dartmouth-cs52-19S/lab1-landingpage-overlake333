In this assignment, I created a landing page based on the Starbucks website.
I mimicked the structure of the page but with my own content - a motorcycle blog.
Using Chrome DevTools, I mimicked the Starbuck's website's structure and style. My webpage has a responsive navigation menu, expanding images, hover states, text inputs, and footer links. 

I was inspired to create a motorcycle blog because, as someone who rides motorcycles,
I have always wanted to take my bike cross-country and document the process. 

What worked: 
- using the Chrom Devtools to make small stylistic choices before editing the actual html file.\ 
- using the class slides to go over syntax and particular CSS transitions
- using flexbox was a very easy and quick method of placing/styling items on the screen 

What didn't work: 
- using background images without the correct dimensions - the image would either wrap or warps. 
- loosing organization in my CSS file - with such a long file, classes would tend get lost if not kept in a particular order
- using different types of units for sizing - it makes changing texts/sizing difficult.
